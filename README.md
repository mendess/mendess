# Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend engineer, who's favourite language is rust and who's hobby is to
teach. **[CV](https://github.com/mendess/cv)**

Currently work at [Speechify](https://speechify.com/) where I use ![kotlin](assets/kotlin-small.png) Kotlin, ![ts](assets/typescript-small.png) Typescript, _and look at ![swift](assets/swift-small.png) Swift from afar_, every day!
